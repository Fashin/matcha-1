42 School Project - Dating Website with a micro-framework. No ORM, Validator or User Managing allowed.

I chose to use NodeJS with the framework Express and mongodb.

you need to clone and install mongodb then

```
npm i --save express
npm i --save express-session
mkdir db
/usr/local/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath /Users/hmassonn/http/MyWebSite/matcha/db
```

then open a new shell and use:

`npm start`

to launch the server, after doing this you can go to localhost:3000/ and have fun
